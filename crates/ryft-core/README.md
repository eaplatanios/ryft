# **Ryft Core:** Work-in-Progress Core APIs

> [!WARNING]
> `ryft` is currently a work in progress and is evolving very actively. APIs and module or crate boundaries may change.

`ryft-core` is intended to host Ryft's core abstractions for tracing, automatic differentiation, and Just-In-Time (JIT)
compilation. Today, the most complete and usable part of this crate is the
[`Parameterized`](https://docs.rs/ryft-core/latest/ryft_core/parameters/trait.Parameterized.html) API.

## Coming Soon

`ryft-core` is expected to grow into the main home for higher-level tracing, automatic differentiation,
and Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation APIs. Those pieces are still being actively developed and are not yet ready
to take a dependency on.
