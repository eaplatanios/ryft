/// recovers the descriptor as `V::Type` and pinning sites write `V: Value<Type = ArrayType>`. It additionally requires
/// [`Debug`] and [`Display`] so that diagnostics, constants, and [`Operation`] metadata can render their carried

    /// staged value (e.g., a staged [`Tracer`](crate::Tracer)'s trace, a [`BatchingTracer`](crate::BatchingTracer)'s
    /// batching level, etc.): dispatch and execution both happen in the live context such a value flows through.
    /// However, they become separate for concrete backend values (e.g., concrete arrays). In those cases, the
    /// [`DispatchDomain`](Self::DispatchDomain) is the constant-only [`EagerContext`](crate::EagerContext) such that
    /// capability calls dispatch to direct implementations instead of a context, while the

    /// values whose rich domain requires state or defaults that cannot be derived from a value (e.g., a client handle)
    /// keep the constant-only domain here too, which simply means free transform entry points do not serve them and an
    /// explicit context must be used instead.

    /// Blanket capability implementations (e.g., the value-level arithmetic sugar) bind through this domain and use its
    /// operation universe as their coherence discriminator: the sugar applies when `V::DispatchDomain::Operation` can
    /// accept the operation being bound. A staged [`Tracer`](crate::Tracer)'s dispatch domain is its live trace, so the
    /// sugar records instructions there. A concrete backend value's dispatch domain is the constant-only
    /// [`EagerContext`](crate::EagerContext), whose [`ConstantOperation`](crate::ConstantOperation) universe accepts
